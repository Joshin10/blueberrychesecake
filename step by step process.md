Eggless Blueberry Cheesecake Cups
 


Ingredients
For the base:
1 cup crushed digestive biscuits
¼ cup melted butter
For the filling
¾ cup softened cream cheese
¼ cup heavy cream
½ cup sweetened condensed milk
2 tsp vanilla extract
Lemon zest
¼ tsp lemon juice
Blueberry jam (optional)
Fresh blueberries
Instructions
Line the cupcake pan with cupcake liners.
Take the crushed digestive biscuits in a bowl and add the melted butter to it.
Combine them well and transfer the mixture to the cupcake pan. Press it down to the base of each cupcake mould.
Refrigerate the crust for 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven at 160 degrees celsius.
For the filling, whip up the softened cream cheese with the heavy cream.
Gradually add the sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, lemon zest and lemon juice and mix until well combined.
Pour this filling over the cooled crust and gently tap to remove any air bubbles.
Top your mini cheesecakes with blueberry jam.
Place the cup cake tray in a deeper tray filled with hot water upto one inch, to create a water bath. This will ensure that the cheesecake bakes slowly and evenly.
Bake the cheesecake at 160C for 35-40 minutes or until the filing starts to set. The centre might seem wobbly but it will continue to cook as the cheesecake cools.
Once the cheesecake is baked, allow it to come to room temperature.
Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least two hours or preferably overnight before unmolding.
Decorate with some whipped cream and fresh blueberries.
